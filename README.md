# GameServerInfo-Bot
A Discord Bot which retrieves data from the DSG Squad Gameserver via Battlemetrics API and displays this information periodically as an embed in a specific textchannel.

In addition, the user can get notified if a new match starts.

Furthermore, the user can use slash-commands to gain statistics about what gamemodes, maps and layer were played recently.
